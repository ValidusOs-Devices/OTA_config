c9fe4f8d408 QS tiles string changes The following tiles all had one thing in common, they all failed to follow AOSP behavior. They all had the label show 'off' when the tile was in the off state. Normal AOSP behavior uses the drawable to indicate whether a tile is off or on. For example the flashlight tile which comes loaded on AOSP doesn't show Flashlight off when the tile is off. You can look at the other tiles such as WiFi, Airplane, Cast, Bluetooth and DND.

135d2af Slim Recents iconpack support [2/2] ezio: adapted IconPackHelper from CM trebuchet (https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/136600/) with latest OmniSwitch improvements; splitted the whole dialog part and moved it into Settings; i've set here Danesh as commit author because he made the original IconPackHelper code long time ago.

a31b6f65a6d drivers: wake_gestures: accept 2 as a valid input for dt2w I am so sick of users complaining that KA doesn't work with fullscreen, which is the intuitive option for our device as we only have two states (on or off), as opposed to some devices that have three states (off, on for half of the screen, or on for the entire screen). Make it so that if the user selects fullscreen (echoing 2 to the path) that it still works.
